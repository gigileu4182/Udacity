# Classifications learning #
## Important notions which are embedded in every classification problem.
%% instances:: (input,vector or attributes that define your input.)
%% concept:: (funciton, maps input to output)..
             (objects in the world -> members in the set)
             (what a thing is..conformable to the 'concept'? true or false)
%% target concept:: **(t.c. is the actual answer.)**
%% hypothesis (class): **all the functions that we are willing to think about.**
%% sample (training set, (input,output))
%% candidate (concept):: going to be tested..
%% testing set.
*the important lesson is .. teacher wants to make sure the students understand..
== they want to make sure they know how to generalize, not by memorizing, but by
applying the concept/the model in mind!!* 

example of ceteri paripas? 
*I want to go to an occupied resterant, but not at 2:00 in the morning.*

a decicition tree == a specific representation \\ 
and an algorithm == how to build the trees

#### Decision tree #### \\ order matters! \\
nodes: attributes
edges: value of attributes
leaves: output/decisions

#### Decision tree learning####
1. Pick best attribute (best: splits the data)
2. ased question
3. follow the answer path
4. go to 1.. until got an answer..

#### D.T expressiveness ####
and, or, not,...
