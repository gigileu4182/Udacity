unsupervised learning == given dataset, given function, optimization

local optimum == improvement based on **local steps!**

- x^2.. at most one bump
- x^3.. at most 2 bumps
- x^4.. at most 3 bumps(up-or down-wards)

- Neighbor function N(X).. 
  - part of algorthm! (can not understand!)
  - seems easy, because global, and F function is the 5433..
- for random starting, the range should be wide.

###### crossover
- locality of bits matters.
- 

###### Estimating Distributions
- 
- dependency trees. (bayesian net? every node has one parent.)
  - no parent ==  independency
  - sampling is easy why?
- minimize KL measure of divergence (it is not a distance)
  - entropy.
  - given parent -> me.
  - J -> J', where J' becomes the minus mutual information
