###### crossover
- locality of bits matters.

###### Estimating Distributions
- 
- dependency trees. (bayesian net? every node has one parent.)
  - no parent ==  independency
  - sampling is easy why?
- minimize KL measure of divergence (it is not a distance)
  - entropy.
  - given parent -> me.
  - J -> J', where J' becomes the minus mutual information
